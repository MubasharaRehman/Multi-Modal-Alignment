kVCT–MVCT Alignment 3D-Slicer

This repository contains **research scripts** for automating two tasks inside [3D Slicer](https://www.slicer.org/):

1. **Alignment** → Align kVCT (moving) to MVCT (fixed) volumes.  
2. **Body Mask Extraction** → Extract binary BODY mask from MVCT segmentations.  

⚠️ **Disclaimer**: These scripts are for research purposes only. They are not intended for clinical or diagnostic use.
